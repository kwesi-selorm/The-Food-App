# The-Recipe-App
The Food App is is an attempt to use an external API to provide recipe, food and nutritional uses.
The first stage is the recipe functionality which provides a user with a list of recipes they can based on the ingredients they have available.  
The endpoint implement allows the user to find recipes that either maximize the usage of ingredients they have or minimize the ingredients they don't have.
The next functionality to implemented when successful is retrieving the full recipe rendered on a a recpipe card or new page, for accessbility of use of the app.
Additional functionality will be added if and when possible.
